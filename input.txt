file fragmentation refes ti the data beign strored in non-contiguous blocks on a storage device,rather than  in a single,unbroken sequence which slows down the file access 
this occurs due to the constant saving and deletion of files which creates gaps that get filled by new data causing files to be split 
to resolve this a process called defragmentation or defrag reorganise the data into continuous blocks
